This study explores the global phenomenon of the flattening Phillips Curve, specifically investigating whether countries with more service-oriented economies exhibit a flatter or steeper slope of the Phillips Curve. The analysis utilizes quarterly data from 57 countries, spanning from Q1 1998 to Q4 2022, and employs the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) model to reassess this trend.

#### Key Objectives:
1. **Trend Verification**: The study verifies the flattening trend of the Phillips Curve by expanding window regression and comparing changes in the slope across two distinct periods.
2. **Service Employment Impact**: By using Employment in Services as a variable, the study assesses if this factor influences the slope of the Phillips Curve using OLS regression methods.

#### Methodology:
- **Data Collection**: The research uses quarterly data for Real GDP (IMF), CPI (World Bank), and annual data for Employment in Services (% of total employment) from the World Bank.
- **NKPC Model**: The NKPC model is used to calculate the slope through the output gap and forecast inflation.
- **HP Filter**: The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter is applied to detrend the real GDP data, estimating the output gap by decomposing the trend and cyclical components.
- **Expanding Window Regression**: This method is used to analyze how the relationship between the output gap and inflation evolves over time.
- **OLS Regression**: Linear regression analyses are conducted for two periods (1998-2009 and 2010-2022) to observe aggregate changes in the slope parameter (Îº).

#### Findings:
- The slope of the Phillips Curve has declined, indicating decreased sensitivity of inflation to the output gap.
- No conclusive evidence was found to attribute this decline to the expansion of the services sector.
- The study suggests that while the slope has indeed decreased, the impact of services on this decline remains inconclusive.

#### Conclusion:
The research concludes that while the Phillips Curve's slope has generally declined across the studied countries, suggesting a reduced sensitivity of inflation to the output gap, it cannot definitively confirm the role of the service sector in this trend. Further research with more robust structural modeling is recommended to understand this relationship better.
